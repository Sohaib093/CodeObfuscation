A Python-based Code Obfuscation Tool that protects source code by transforming it into a harder-to-read form while preserving functionality. This tool supports multiple obfuscation techniques such as variable renaming, string encoding, control flow modification, and bytecode-level protection. Ideal for securing scripts, preventing reverse engineering, and safeguarding intellectual property.
